Depreciation is the systematic allocation of the depreciable amount of an asset over  its useful life. \nThe depreciable amount of an asset is the cost of an asset or other amount  substituted for cost, less its \nresidual val ue. The useful life of an asset is the period over  which an asset is expected to be available for \nuse by an entity, or the number of production  or similar units expected to be obtained from the asset by \nthe entity.  \n2. For the purpose of this Schedule, the term depreciation includes amortisation.  \n3.
